Introduction and background: An introduction that motivates & outlines a clear, specific set of research questions. Also, provide some background on your topic.
Introduction
Since the advancement of technology, the creation of video games has played an influential role in being a source of entertainment for everyone around the world. Everyone is able to find a game that they like in order to pass time and fulfill their creative needs. 
Background information

Research Questions
What are the most selling platforms of games over the years across different regions?
What is the most selling genre of games over the years across different regions?
Who is the most selling publisher of games over the years across different regions?
Data collection: Specification of your data sources and collection process.
Scraping from Kaggle and importing to a dataset
Analysis: This is the bulk of the report which either has a presentation of the groupâ€™s key findings and take-aways or gives the detail of how someone would interact and what people should take away from the shiny app. If you choose to do a shiny app, be sure to include a link to the shinyapps.io site.
